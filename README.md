RELATIVE TABLE EXPLANATION
ITS THE SIMPLIEST THING
I HAVE VALUES OF 0 to 255 in a y row of a bitmap for luminess
I store in a table of 0 and 1 ocupping 32 bytes 256 bits witch are active for instances luminance of x = 10 and , y=2 its 34 i store to 1 the 34 value bit of 32 bytes 0 to 255 possibilites it gives like for instances in that row 137 diferent one values.. i count them, Relate them to that value in num1 soo that 34 value for instances corresponds to just 12 value or soo much less and save the lumincance relative values of that row but before i save the 32 bytes...
Moving on in height of bitmap i do this for every ypslon height values of luminance and Then i repeat the loop to u and the v
The to reconstruct i will just need to regain those YUV values and RGB them out
Most likely high quality image lossless over less size than avif 
(similar to 80% just on high compression paq8px emma cmix etc and 4 seconds compress on the speedy ones with great values over 95% just of avif size â€“ the dat size compressed on a good ratio of the bmp of 1024x717 pixels 24 bits of yuv with no alpha becomes a compressed dat file of 80 to 70% just of avif full kb size).
Several files of several formats of several sizes are in this directory explaining benchmarks on size do test the speed of zpaq -m5s- t4 3 seconds a file of dat.
