I have been using 48x48 pixels grid
and compress over zpaq on -m5 -t4 the dat file.
the avif file on pixillion to compress from bmp to avif takes 18 seconds (i dont know if one thread)
but on zpaq i get only 4 seconds on 4 threads -m5 -t4 my dat lossless file and becomes like 90% the size of avif lossless most of the times.
